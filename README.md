Egezapal is a company that deals with solving problems using technology. Presently dealing with parking  issues mostly in shopping malls. The platform helps motorists to find the parking slots with much ease. 
##EGEZAPAL MANTRA 
Bigger, Better and Reliable. 
##THE PROBLEM 
Many motorists find it difficult to locate a parking slot, ending up driving around wasting time,  consuming more fuel and most of them get frustrated. 
##THE SOLUTION 
Egezapal platform uses a huge screen that is placed at the entrance of a shopping mall. It displays the  total parking slots of that particular mall, the ones that are occupied and the ones that are vacant for all  levels. In addition to the screen, there are LEDS at each slot that will be shunning conspicuously to help  the motorist to spot the vacant slot with much ease. All this is made possible by the use of sensors that  are installed in each parking slot detecting and analyzing the status of a parking slot and sending the  feedback to our databases after every 60 milliseconds. 
This helps a motorist to decide the level to drive to for parking instead of driving blindly and around levels to check whether there is a slot or not. Therefore, minimizing on the fuel wastage, Time wastage  and unnecessary frustrations, thereby increasing efficiency. As we all know, time is money, nobody is  willing to waste it rather to work towards minimizing the usage but trying to save as much as possible.  
##FUTURE 
Egezapal has a goal, a goal to expand in future to CBD. In addition to the screen, Egezapal plans to have  a mobile application that will be enabling motorists to scan the barcode using their smart phones at the  entrance and pay their expenses using the app. The charges will depend on how long the person stays in  
the mall. It will of course come with many advantages like, adverts from the particular malls as per the  frequency of visits to that mall made by the user, take ways, promotions just to mention a few. As seen  the app will minimize queuing at the paying booths and the annoying machines that sometimes stays  with customerâ€™s balance/change or fails totally and have to call someone to manually dismantle the  machine so as to get the change/balance for the customer. Egezapal is here to solve all these problems.
